1. all photos
2. red photos
3. green photos
4. blue photos
5. More Folower

Upon loading the app the user should see a list of all flowers images. When user clicks on a button, the corresponding API should be called and the UI should be populated with updated images. For example, clicking on Red button displays a list of red photos for the user. The total number of pictures should be display on the screen as well.
